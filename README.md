# 2DOrthogonal_Polynomial_Decomposition
OPD implementation with application to a IR sequence of a simulated CFRP sample and two real CFRP and GFRP samples with teflon insertions. Recreates the results presented in Paper "Characterization of defects of pulsed thermography inspections by orthogonal polynomial decomposition"
